lets start with the simplest form of webpack

blog post about using webpack to learn the language as it is meant to be written and developed with

compare to ruby and elixir stating experience

this is why theres a stigma

compare the slope of increaseing competency and scope in programming languages

explain how that slope is so much steeper in js
... its ridiculous
... makes sense that people would just say fuck it.

maybe we should explain the giant leaning tower of code and how the "stdlib" of js is utterly lacking

things that look like they should be vanilla JS just aren't

explain why these difference in startup experience matter

explain how certain people approach languages and how that approach can end up in pain and misery for traditional progamming backgrounds for js "I want to use the cli and files that I touch myself to interact with the modern form of the language, I want crisp abstraction from whatever happens when I type some form of 'language please interpret this file'"


"I want a stable, gradual slope of of asks from the language" aka "ok I can write input and output from the language I'd like to start writing to files,... Id like to have simple interactions with a database, I'd like to experience the code on a browser' etc, etc



the js ecosystem does not take into account the learning experience whatsoever

A history lesson is needed to even come to some understanding of the stack of js as a whole because upon hearing things about it you feel like you dont understand it until you know "why" and its tied up in this stupid story about netscape and java.
