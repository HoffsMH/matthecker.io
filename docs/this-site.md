## This Site

And what went(and is probably still going) into it.

There are different types of personal websites.
interactive resume type sites, there are simple business cards with various means of contact, personal portfolio sites complete with fancy scroll animations and mockups. Here I'll detail the design and reasoning that is going into this website as I am creating it, I think it will probably make a good first blog post.

#### General outline of what I want
From previous attempts at a personal website I DO know that there are some things I want to avoid.

- A Backend
  - I have no idea why I thought at the time that it would be a good idea to make a personal website that sits atop a rails server in heroku.
- Too many moving parts in general
  - I don't want to maintain
- A separate blog or a lack of blog.


- Ok so we it will be a simple blog and about/contact page 
#### But where will the posts be stored?
Either in the ap

#### Design

#### What I want to get out of this
#### Dev-ops

There are different approaches
just google  "impressive personal websites"

things I learned from previous attempts

This thing might too go the way of all the other personal website's I've made in the past
